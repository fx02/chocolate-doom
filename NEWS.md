## 3.0.0 (2019-08-15)

  Competition Doom 3.0 is based on Chocolate Doom 3.1.
  See Chocolate Doom 3.0 history for changes:
  https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom

  Imported most of v2 Competition features into v3:
  - naming, icons & settings
  - in game & end screen timer, novert always on
  - show stats screen after EXM8
  - enable Doom movie recording
  - using -printstats & -record outputs stats to stats.txt
  - demo metadata
  - competition setup menu
  - alternate strafe key

  IN PROGRESS/TODO:
  - high resolution

  BUGS:
 - if demo filename is longer than 256 chars it won't be not recorded
 - weird artefact with timer in top left corner
 - demo metadata version is a bit bugged
 - cnlauncher does not play demos properly
